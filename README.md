# Høst Bageri Integrations

This project provides integrations for automating accounting and reporting for Høst Bageri, synchronizing transaction and payout data from [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) to [e-conomic](https://www.e-conomic.com/). It fetches transactions and payouts from SumUp, processes and summarizes them, and posts the relevant journal entries to e-conomic, tailored for bakery operations.

## Features

- Fetches transactions and payouts from SumUp API
- Summarizes daily and monthly revenue, cash, and refunds
- Posts journal entries to e-conomic via API
- Imports product and transaction data into a local SQLite database using Prisma
- Supports category-based revenue reporting for bakery products

## Project Structure

- `src/clients/`: API clients for SumUp and e-conomic
- `src/services/`: Business logic for syncing and importing data
- `src/jobs/`: CLI scripts for running sync and import jobs
- `src/types/`: Type definitions for SumUp and e-conomic data
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions (logging, date, caching, etc.)
